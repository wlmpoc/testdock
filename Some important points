DTR registry backup - what object are actually backed up and what objects are omitted from backup (image blobs, dtr configurations, repository metadata, role based access controls)

When running a container, in which case the docker engine itself creates a volume with a random id and name and attach to container without needing us to create one before hand

content trust for image signing and verification - export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1 to enable on the shell rather than at the daemon level

If a volume is created and mounted to a service whose replicas share same node (run on same node), the volume is created only once and the same is shared. So, writes to the volume at the same time may cause random behaviour


From where would you download the package repository URL to set up docker enterprise edition on your machine? Docker hub / Docker store. From where would you download license keys Docker hub / Docker store

if you want to specify that the service should not create tasks on manager node, how would you do it? node.role != manager

in a cluster where there is a quorum which one situation would cause loss of a quorum:
1. 4 managers - 2 health and 2 unhealthy
2. 5 managers - 3 health and 2 unhealthy
3. 1 manager - and healthy
4. 3 managers - 2 health and 1 unhealthy

If a cluster is spread across 3 data centers in 3 availability zones, which would be the spread strategy for the managers

1. 3,3,1
2. 3,2,2
3. 5,1,1
4. 4,2,1
