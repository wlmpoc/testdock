# Swarm notes

## Key Concepts:

One of the key advantages of swarm services over standalone containers is that you can modify a serviceâ€™s configuration, including the networks and volumes it is connected to, without the need to manually restart the service.

To deploy your application to a swarm, you submit a **_service definition_** to a manager node. 
Manager Node
* perform orchestration -- orchestrator
* dispatch tasks to workers -- despatcher
* participate in leader election -- manager
* schedules tasks based on available resources & uses spread strategy -- scheduler
* uses ingress load balancing -- to publish ports
* uses internal load balancing -- distribute requests based on DNS name
* raft consensus algorithm

Orchestrators typically do the following:-
- The tasks of an orchestrator
- Reconciling the desired state
- Replicated and global services
- Service discovery
- Routing
- Load balancing
- Scaling
- Self-healing
- Zero downtime deployments by doing configurable updates. (Sets parallelism and delay between updates of each task)
- Affinity and location awareness
- Security
- Secure communication and cryptographic node identity
- Secure networks and network policies
--- Role-based access control (RBAC)
--- Secrets
--- Content trust
--- Reverse uptime
